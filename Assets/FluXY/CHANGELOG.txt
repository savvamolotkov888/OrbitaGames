# Change Log
All notable changes to “FluXY - 2.5D fluid simulator” will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-01-20

### Added
- Tangent space simulation.
- Support for arbitrary meshes in containers: no longer restricted to a rectangular plane.
- Support for container surface normal maps.
- Per-pixel gravity.
- Fluid adhesion (causes a fraction of the fluid to stick to the container's surface)
- Fluid surface tension (causes fluid to form rounded "drops")
- Target rotation can now be derived from transform rotation.
- Targets can now splat both linear and angular velocity

### Fixed
- Aspect ratio of targets was incorrectly rounded to integer values.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-12-03

### Added
- Support for subdivided container meshes.
- New URP-specific sample scenes.
- URP opaque and transparent ShaderGraph shaders, driven using FluXY.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-09-27
- Initial release.
